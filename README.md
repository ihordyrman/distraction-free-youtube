A lightweight Chrome extension that hides distracting elements on YouTube so you can stay focused on the content you came to watch.

Six configurable distraction categories, all hidden by default:

| Category        | What it hides                                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Shorts          | Shorts shelves on the home page and in feeds     |
| Recommendations | The sidebar recommendations panel on video pages |
| End Screen      | End screen overlays and suggested video cards    |
| Home Feed       | The entire home feed grid                        |
| Comments        | Comment sections and comment teasers             |
| Trending        | The trending page feed                           |
